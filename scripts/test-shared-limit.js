//
// WHY: rate limits lived in a per-process Map, so scaling 1 -> 2 replicas
// doubled every one of them. The RATE_LIMIT_REPLICAS divisor fixes any budget
// larger than the replica count but CANNOT fix a budget of 1: dividing 1 by 2
// floors back to 1, because zero is an outage rather than a limit. The trial's
// per-tool cap is exactly 1, so it stayed doubled — measured in production as
// the same tool granting two trials.
//
// One shared counter is the only construction that makes a cap of 1 hold. These
// assertions run against an injected store rather than a live Redis: the
// property is "two callers share one counter", and a fake proves that exactly
// while a skipped test proves nothing.

// a replica that could not reach Redis stopped refusing and began handing out
// its own private allowance: fail-OPEN, reached by a route the fail-closed code
// could not see. Observed in production as one tool granting two trials in a
// row while the logs showed connection timeouts.
