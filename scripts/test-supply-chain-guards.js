// Supply-chain guards for the packages we PUBLISH and the pipeline that
// publishes them. Every assertion here encodes a 2026 attack that actually
// happened to somebody else:
//
//   - npm publish tokens must never share a step with code execution. The
//     ChainDrop/Shai-Hulud worm family steals exactly this: a publish token
//     exposed to a dependency's install script, then used to republish every
//     package that token can reach. Our llamaindex publish step used to run a
//     remote `npm install` of a large third-party tree with NODE_AUTH_TOKEN in
//     env (fixed 2026-08-05).
//   - Published packages must ship no install hooks: a consumer running
//     `npm install agent402-*` must never execute our code.
//   - Published tarballs must be `files`-allowlisted, so a stray .env/.npmrc
//     can never ship.
//   - Remote installs in tests must pin an exact version and skip scripts.
//
// Offline (reads the workflow + package manifests; no network, no installs).
