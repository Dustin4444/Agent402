// Receipts: the caller's OWN settled payments, in the shape a finance system
// posts, and nobody else's.
//
// Two properties are the whole product and both are pinned here:
//
//   1. IDENTITY-BOUND BY THE SIGNATURE, NEVER A PARAMETER. The wallet comes
//      from the verified EIP-3009 authorization. A `wallet` field in the body
//      must change nothing - if it ever did, this route would be a way to read
//      any buyer's payables, which is the customer list we refuse to publish
//      anywhere else.
//
//   2. EVIDENCE SURVIVES. settlementTx, responseSha256 and attestationUid are
//      what make a row auditable by someone who does not trust us. A row that
//      drops them is just a number we assert.
//
// Offline: the ledger is driven directly with a temp database.
