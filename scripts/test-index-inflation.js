// `sellers` counts ORIGINS. Publishing only that number under the word
// "sellers" is instance inflation — the exact thing we document about
// third-party registries.
//
//   node scripts/test-index-inflation.js
//
// WHY: measured on our own live index 2026-07-31 — 858 of 2,008 origins
// carrying a Base payTo shared that address with at least one other origin, and
// a single address spanned 144 origins. /api/index reported sellerCount 2258
// against ~789 distinct payees in the sample. Both numbers are true; only one
// of them answers "how many operators are out there", and we were publishing
// the other one under a label that implies it.
//
// So the operator-level proxy is published BESIDE the origin count, never
// instead of it, and this pins the arithmetic — especially that addresses
// differing only in checksum case are one payee, since folding them wrongly
// (or failing to) moves the headline number.
