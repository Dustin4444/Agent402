// GUARD: the Ox Alpha free trial is the ONE exception to the trial's structural
// safety rule, and this pins the two properties that make the exception safe.
//
// Normally a trial can only ever reach a PoW-eligible (pure-CPU) route, so it
// can never give away money we paid upstream. Ox Alpha is an upstream call, and
// it is allowed only because the model is currently free. That is a fact about
// a third party that will change without notice, so:
//
//   1. the trial is offered only while a FRESH read of the live catalog shows
//      the model at exactly 0 prompt and 0 completion, and
//   2. the trial must NEVER widen proof-of-work redemption to the route - PoW
//      is cheap and repeatable, so a solved challenge on an upstream-calling
//      route would be an unmetered free proxy.
