// Socket.dev supply-chain gate — fails on NEW critical/high alerts in what we
// publish and what our published packages pull in.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS: our own code is audited by scripts/test-supply-chain-guards.js,
// but the 2026 worm waves land in DEPENDENCIES — a package that was clean last
// week ships a malicious patch version this week. This asks a third party
// (Socket) "has anything in this tree started behaving like malware?" on every
// run, which is the question a static audit of our own repo cannot answer.
//
// SCOPE: our 11 published packages, the tree that ships to users of
// agent402-mcp (the npx path), AND the server's own PRODUCTION tree.
//
// The server tree was originally excluded as "never reaches a buyer" - wrong
// reasoning, corrected 2026-08-05 after Socket's GitHub app surfaced 61 alerts
// this gate had never looked at. The server is what handles buyer money; a
// compromised dependency there is worse than one in a published package, not
// better. Dev-only dependencies stay out (they never run in production, and
// the batch call is priced per request so scope is nearly free).
//
// FAILURE POLICY:
//   - critical/high alert on any scanned package  -> exit 1 (block)
//   - Socket unreachable / quota exhausted / auth failure -> LOUD warning,
//     exit 0. A third-party outage is not evidence of compromise, and blocking
//     releases on someone else's uptime is its own outage. The warning is
//     deliberately noisy: this repo has been bitten by an alarm that treated
//     "unreadable" as "fine" and silently never fired (charged-failure, 2026-07).
//   - middle/low alerts -> printed, never blocking. They are capability
//     descriptions (networkAccess, envVars) that every HTTP client trips.
//
// Usage:  SOCKET_API_TOKEN=... node scripts/socket-check.js [--strict]
//         --strict also fails on middle severity (not used in CI by default)
