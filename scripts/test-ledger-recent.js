// WHY: the revenue rail card built its `recent[]` by chunked eth_getLogs across
// six EVM rails on every snapshot refresh. A production egress census measured
// 221 Alchemy calls per refresh, and crawler traffic kept the cache warm up to
// 144 times a day - on the order of a million billed calls a month, to
// redisplay transfers the ledger had already stored.
//
// The ledger is the same data from the same source, indexed once by the
// background sync. Balances still need a live read - a balance is not a
// transfer - but those are single eth_call reads that already went
// publics-first and were never the expensive part.
//
// The assertions below are mostly about the FALLBACK, because that is where
// this can do damage: an empty ledger must mean "go scan", never "no revenue".
