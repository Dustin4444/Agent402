// The research pipeline must never SELL a report whose plan collapsed.
//
// Found 2026-09-11 by reading a $1.10 research-max: meta said searches_run 1
// and sources_listed 5 against a tier configured for 12 searches and 40
// sources. Two defects stacked, and both are pinned here from source because
// neither is visible in the response shape - the report reads fine, it is
// simply built on a twelfth of the evidence the buyer paid for.
//
//   1. The planner's catch was EMPTY, so an upstream 429, a timeout and a
//      malformed JSON body were indistinguishable from each other.
//   2. `need` (the evidence floor) is a THIRD of however many sub-questions
//      survived. When the fallback collapsed that to 1, the floor became 1, so
//      one search cleared the guard that exists to refuse thin reports - the
//      same failure disarmed its own check, at full price, on a tier that had
//      then done less work than the $0.60 one plans.
