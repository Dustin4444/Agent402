//
// WHY: /api/stats published `chargedButFailed: 1726` with no caveat. Against
// 25,800 USDC calls that advertises a ~6.7% "we took your money and delivered
// nothing" rate to anyone evaluating us as a seller. It is false.
//
// Every one of the 200 retained events is status 402 — a facilitator declining
// settlement, where the buyer KEEPS their money and we simply lose the sale —
// and there has been no event at all since the recording bug was fixed. The
// lifetime counter cannot be un-polluted because the pre-fix events carry no
// marker, so the fix is to publish the meaningful number beside it and name the
// defect rather than quietly dropping the bad one.
//
// This is the same failure we diagnose in others: a self-reported metric that
// does not survive scrutiny. Ours was worse than theirs in one respect — it
// defamed us.
