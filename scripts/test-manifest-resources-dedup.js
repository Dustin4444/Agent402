// Locks the resources[] dedup fix (2026-08-16 audit): serviceManifest()
// mapped Object.keys(catalog) straight to URLs with no dedup - a handful of
// tools (e.g. /api/memory) are registered TWICE in the catalog, once per
// HTTP method (GET read, POST write), so their URL appeared twice in
// /.well-known/x402's resources[] with no way for a consumer to tell why.
// x402scan's discovery format wants a flat URL list, not a method-annotated
// one (openapi.json already carries that), so the fix is to dedupe by URL.
//
// Offline - calls serviceManifest() directly with a fixture catalog that
// deliberately includes a GET+POST pair on the same path, so this is a
// non-vacuous check (a catalog with no duplicate paths at all would pass
// trivially and prove nothing).
