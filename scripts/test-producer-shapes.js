// Consumers must only read fields the PRODUCERS actually emit.
//
//   node scripts/test-producer-shapes.js
//
// WHY: this exact defect shipped four times in one day, and twice AFTER a test
// was written to prevent it.
//
//   * provenByChain() read `payToByNetwork` off routableSellerSummaries(),
//     which did not emit it -> the router's chain evidence was empty, always.
//   * probePaywall() filtered on `t.url`, which NO tool producer emits ->
//     the paywall signal was permanently null.
//   * advertisedPayToEvidence() read `payToByNetwork` off sellerDetail(),
//     which did not emit it -> the paid seller-trust tool reported "advertises
//     no payTo" for every seller.
//
// Every one passed its own unit tests, because those tests built the input by
// hand. A fixture cannot notice that it is fiction: the test asserts the
// function works on the shape the AUTHOR imagined, and production hands it a
// different one. Unit tests over hand-built objects are structurally incapable
// of catching this, no matter how many you write.
//
// So this asserts the CONTRACT BETWEEN modules, using real producer output and
// no fixtures: for each (producer, consumer) pair, the fields the consumer
// reads must exist on what the producer returns.
