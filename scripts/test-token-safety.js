// The cheap EVM token-safety verdict, offline.
//
//   node scripts/test-token-safety.js
//
// Why the tool exists: our only EVM answer to "is this token safe to trade" was
// token-risk at $0.60, an LLM-synthesised report - the wrong shape and price for
// a pre-trade check an agent makes in one call. Solana already had
// sol-token-safety at $0.005; EVM had nothing under sixty cents, and a seller
// running the SAME keyless GoPlus leg sells it at $0.01.
//
// What this pins is the judgement, not the upstream: the verdict is derived from
// named facts, and an UNANSWERED check is never counted as safe. The first cut
// broke that rule with `(g.sellTaxPct ?? 0)`, which read "upstream did not say"
// as "zero tax" - caught by writing this table.
