// The EDGAR politeness gate bounded the BUILD from the start. It never bounded
// the WAIT, and those are different things. With 2 concurrent and a queue of 8,
// the last waiter could sit through four full rounds before its own build began
// - up to ~60s on a page meant to answer in one - and nothing capped it.
//
// The module's own comment claims a burst "degrades instead of piling up",
// which was true only for requests turned away PAST the queue. The eight inside
// it piled up silently. Found when a 1062-URL sitemap sweep aborted two fund
// pages at a 20s client timeout; the caller that matters is not the test but
// any crawler walking our sitemap, Googlebot included.
