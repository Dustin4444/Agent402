// The Algorand sweep's "expected no AVM accept" rule must match the SERVER's.
//
// A tool advertises no algorand accept for two legitimate reasons, and the
// weekly sweep has to know both or it reports a design decision as a rail that
// silently went away. On 2026-08-24 it did exactly that for three media tiers:
// the sweep was right to ask, and the answer lived in a local const inside
// server.js that it had no way to reach.
//
// Both predicates are now imported from the server. This pins that they are
// imported rather than restated, because a copy is what drifts.
