# A402-06 / CVE-2026-8461 (FFmpeg MagicYUV heap overflow) verification.
#
# Run this INSIDE the deployed container (Railway shell) or against a locally
# built image. It records the ffmpeg build and whether the vulnerable MagicYUV
# decoder is even compiled in, so the live image is auditable without guessing.
#
# Context: Agent402 only invokes ffmpeg for AUDIO (audio-convert/-normalize pass
# `-vn`) and ffprobe for container metadata (`-show_format -show_streams`) — none
# of which decode a MagicYUV video frame, so the published PoW/exploit path is
# not exercised in normal operation. Pin/patch anyway; do NOT run a real exploit
# file to "prove" reachability.
