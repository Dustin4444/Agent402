// WHY: we told agents "a failed call is NEVER charged - structurally". Our own
// charged-failure alarm exists precisely for the case where that is false: a
// non-200 carrying a settle receipt that does not say success:false is counted
// as charged-but-failed and paged on. Publishing an absolute where we operate a
// detector for the exception is an overclaim, and it is the kind a buyer only
// discovers when they are the exception.
//
// The published contract is now derivable by the buyer from the response they
// already hold. This asserts the four branches stay stated, stay mutually
// exclusive, and that the copy never re-absolutises.
