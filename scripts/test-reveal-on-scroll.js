// Reveal-on-scroll ([data-reveal] sections) — offline unit tests. No network,
// no browser: string assertions on the inline script ledgerShell emits,
// matching this repo's established pattern for validating inline-script
// correctness structurally (see test-theme.js's a402ToggleMenu checks).
//
// Real bug this locks in (found 2026-08-14 from a live mobile report - "some
// screens go off screen while scrolling"): the observer used to TOGGLE
// ml-reveal-in on every intersection change, adding it when a section entered
// view and REMOVING it the moment the section's visible fraction dropped
// under the 8% threshold - including while the section was still partially
// on screen, scrolling past the top edge. A user scrolling down watched
// content fade out and shift 18px *while still looking at it*, which reads
// exactly like "it went off screen" on an ordinary scroll, not a rendering
// bug. Fixed to one-shot: reveal once, unobserve, never re-hide - the
// standard behaviour for every scroll-reveal effect on the web, and the only
// half of the old behaviour the "reload deep in the page still animates"
// goal ever actually needed (a section already in view on the observer's
// first callback reveals immediately regardless of whether removal exists).
