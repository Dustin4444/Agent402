// The Dockerfile used to `COPY scripts ./scripts`, which shipped ~90 test files
// into the production image and put a cache-busting layer in front of every
// layer below it - and a test-only edit is the most common change in this repo,
// so almost every deploy rebuilt from that point down.
//
// It now copies only the files the SERVER needs at runtime, by name. That is
// faster and smaller, and it is also a trapdoor: adding a runtime import from
// scripts/ and forgetting the Dockerfile produces an image that passes every
// test here and crashes on boot in production, where the file is absent.
//
// So the required set is DERIVED from the source, never listed. Anything src/,
// worker/ or start.js reaches for under scripts/ must be copied.
