//   node scripts/rail-selfheal.js            # report only
//   RAILWAY_TOKEN=... node scripts/rail-selfheal.js   # report + restart on recovery
//
// WHY: src/payments.js drops a rail whose facilitator cannot be reached, so one
// dead third party costs one chain instead of every paid route. That decision is
// made ONCE AT BOOT - its own warning reads "a dropped rail returns on the next
// boot where its facilitator answers". So when the third party recovers, the
// rail stays dead until a human redeploys. Celo sat exactly that way while the
// service advertised twelve chains and served eleven.
//
// A live in-process swap of the offer was prototyped and REJECTED: rebuilding
// `accepts` while serving produced an EMPTY offer under test, and the failure
// mode there is "nobody can pay". Restarting re-runs the boot sequence, which is
// the most tested path in the system (quiet gate, drain, healthcheck). Boring
// beats clever on the payment path.
//
// THE RULE, and it is deliberately strict: restart only when BOTH hold
//   1. /api/rails reports a configured rail that is NOT offered, and
//   2. that rail's own facilitator answers /supported RIGHT NOW.
// A rail that is genuinely down is reported and left alone - restarting would
// not fix it and would just churn production on someone else's outage.
