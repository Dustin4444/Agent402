// Proves the image pipeline no longer occupies the event loop: while N concurrent
// image-resize calls are in flight against a booted server, a plain /health
// request must still answer inside a small budget.
//
// This is the regression this test exists for. image-resize / image-convert /
// image-thumbnail are free on the authless MCP connector and free via
// proof-of-work, and jimp decodes in pure JS synchronously. Measured with this
// exact source and burst, before and after the work moved into
// src/tools/image-worker.js:
//   inline (before)  burst 3.1-3.3s, /health median 363ms, worst 435-871ms,
//                    and only 7-8 probes landed in the whole window
//   worker (after)   burst ~1.5s, /health median 2ms, worst 51-63ms, 58 probes
// The earlier report of the same failure was starker still: three concurrent
// calls on a 25M-pixel source took /health from 39ms to 6.1s.
//
// The source is the exact hostile shape: a solid 4000x4000 PNG is ~67KB on the
// wire but 16M pixels to decode, which is the most a free caller is allowed
// (FREE_MAX_SRC_PIXELS). Cheap to send, expensive to decode.
