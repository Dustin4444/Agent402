// WHY: Sei and Optimism shipped as payment rails without an entry in
// CAIP2_NAMES, so every settlement on them was booked under its raw CAIP-2 id
// and shown that way on the PUBLIC /api/stats - "eip155:10" rather than
// "optimism". Nothing was lost on-chain, but the named bucket and the id
// bucket are different counters, so per-chain revenue read low for both and a
// reader comparing rails would have drawn the wrong conclusion.
//
// The same gap left older chains split across two rows at once: monad 19
// beside eip155:143 42, celo 35 beside eip155:42220 16, stellar beside
// stellar:pubnet. Those are historical counters from before their entry
// existed, which is why the merge happens at read time.
//
// This is the guard that makes adding a rail without naming it fail loudly.
