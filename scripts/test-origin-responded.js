//
// WHY: ~32% of our index (742 of 2,296 crawled origins) reached us only as
// `bazaar-fallback` — the manifest fetch failed AND the OpenAPI fetch failed,
// so every field was synthesised from a third-party registry row. The crawl was
// still recorded as successful, because it completed, so those origins sat at
// health 1 / routable true and the marketplace rendered them "healthy". Sampling
// 60 live: 28 returned 404 or 301, several of them marked perfectly healthy.
//
// This is the exact defect we diagnosed in a third party the same day — a seller
// at health 1 with dead paid routes — at scale, in our own data, on a public
// page. A crawl completing is not a seller answering.

// whose root, /.well-known/x402, /openapi.json and /llms.txt all answer 404 was
// still routable at health 1 with a four-tool catalogue synthesised entirely
// from a registry row. Two fields, one condition, read once - so pin that the
// crawl branch derives BOTH from the same expression. A behavioural test cannot
// reach this line (it needs a live crawl of a dead origin), and the failure it
// guards is silent: the entry looks healthy, which is the whole problem.
