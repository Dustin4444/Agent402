//   node scripts/test-fx-failover.js          (offline, stubbed fetch)
//
// WHY: fx-dashboard has two publishers - api.frankfurter.dev as primary and
// open.er-api.com as a keyless fallback - and the fallback was wired to the
// primary's catch block only. A primary that returns eventually, rather than
// failing, held the whole call.
//
// Measured 2026-08-03: the primary answered in ~0.06s warm but 7.8s and 11.6s
// cold; the fallback answered in ~0.08s every time. On the inherited 15s
// timeout with one retry, a cold primary could hold a PAID $0.015 call for up
// to 30s, and prod's self-check (12s budget) was recording fx-dashboard as a
// 504 outage while a healthy second publisher sat unused.
//
// The invariant: the primary is on a short leash, so "slow" becomes "failed"
// fast enough for the fallback to do its job.
