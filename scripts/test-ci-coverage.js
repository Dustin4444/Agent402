// WHY: four suites written in one day — covering a paywall bypass, a router
// spend gate, a wish-board input filter and a new payment scheme — were never
// referenced in deploy.yml. Each was proven to fail under a mutation of the
// defect it guards, and each guarded nothing, because nothing ran it. A test
// that exists but is not invoked is worse than no test: it looks like coverage
// on the file listing and in the commit message, and it is the same class of
// error as a green result that means nothing.
//
// Writing a test and wiring a test are separate acts, and only one of them was
// ever enforced. This enforces the other.
//
// Suites that legitimately do not belong in the main test job are listed in
// EXEMPT with a REASON — a named exemption is a decision, an unreferenced file
// is an accident, and the point is to make the two distinguishable.
