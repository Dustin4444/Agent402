// What a seller can buy by renaming, pinned as numbers.
//
// The router weights a query term at up to 10 in the slug (or a curated
// alias), 2 in the name, and 1 anywhere in the description, tags or category.
// Twice now we have told a seller those weights in an email, and both times
// they rewrote the operationId rather than the product. It worked, honestly,
// because the keywords were true of their endpoint - but the weighting is an
// incentive we publish, and nothing measured what it is worth.
//
// Measured 2026-09-19, before writing any of this down:
//
//   * PLACEMENT PREMIUM ~2.4x. The same words, same query, score 13 when they
//     sit in the description and 31 when they are moved into the slug. That is
//     the whole lever, and it is real. (A hand simulation of the per-term
//     arithmetic alone said 9 and 27; the live scorer is the oracle here,
//     because it also applies the name-as-implicit-alias rule, and the numbers
//     asserted below are its numbers, not the simulation's.)
//   * IT IS BOUNDED BY QUERY LENGTH. The gain is at most 4 per query TERM, so
//     a 40-keyword slug scores 8 to 12 on ordinary two and three word queries
//     against live winning scores of 14 to 28. A broad stuffer lands mid-pack;
//     it cannot buy the catalog. Stuffing only pays on long natural-language
//     queries, where the stuffer still has to match the words a user typed,
//     which means being on topic.
//   * A LENGTH PENALTY WOULD HIT THE WRONG PEOPLE. Sampled 429 external slugs:
//     94% are five tokens or fewer, and the long tail is almost entirely
//     FastAPI auto-generated ids (kr_news_kpop_api_v1_kr_news_kpop_get,
//     model_route_model_route_get) where the framework repeats the path into
//     the operationId. Those are accidents, not gaming, and a rule keyed on
//     length would demote them for using a default.
//
// So this file changes no behaviour. It exists so that the three facts above
// stay true: if a future weighting tweak makes stuffing pay materially more,
// or starts penalizing a framework-shaped slug, CI says so instead of a seller
// discovering it. Both directions are asserted, because a guard that only
// checks "stuffing does not win" would be satisfied by a ranker that had
// stopped working at all.
