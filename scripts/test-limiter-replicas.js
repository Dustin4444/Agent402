// Rate limits are per-PROCESS, so replicas multiply them.
//
//   node scripts/test-limiter-replicas.js
//
// WHY: buckets live in a Map inside one process. Scaling the service from 1 to
// 2 replicas silently doubled EVERY limit built on createLimiter — the trial
// caps, the proof-of-work tier, the MCP free tier, and the operator
// credential-guessing bound, which is a security control. It was caught only by
// probing production and seeing a per-tool trial granted twice.
//
// No single-process test could have found it, which is the point: the defect
// lives in the gap between how we test (one process) and how we run (several).
//
// RATE_LIMIT_REPLICAS divides each budget so the SYSTEM-WIDE total matches the
// configured intent. It is deliberately the conservative approximation — a
// client pinned to one replica gets its share, never the whole budget — because
// for a security bound, too tight is the right direction to be wrong in.
