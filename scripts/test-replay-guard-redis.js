// WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-08-16). test-replay-guard.js proves the guard's STATE
// MACHINE (concurrent/sequential replay refused, release-on-failure, TTL,
// eviction) entirely against the per-process fallback - it never sets
// REDIS_URL, so it can never prove the property the Redis backing exists for:
// that TWO SEPARATE createReplayGuard() instances (standing in for two app
// replicas) sharing one Redis actually behave like ONE shared guard. A stub
// client would only prove "the code calls set/get/del", the same shallow
// coverage this repo has been burned by before (see test-redis-integration.js's
// own header) - this drives the real client against a real server instead.
//
// Deliberately does not skip when REDIS_URL is unset: a skipped integration
// test is how the cross-replica gap this guard now closes went uncaught for
// as long as it did.
