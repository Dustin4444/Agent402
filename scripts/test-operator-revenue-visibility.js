// Locks two 2026-08-16 audit fixes to the operator dashboard, offline (calls
// getOperatorBreakdown/operatorPage directly, no server boot):
//
//   1. "Ops-cost-vs-revenue visibility for rails with zero external revenue":
//      viaUSDCByNetwork only ever carries a key for a rail that has settled
//      at least once, so a configured-but-unused rail is invisible by
//      omission, not flagged. getOperatorBreakdown() now takes an
//      `offeredNetworks` list and returns `railBreakdown`, an explicit row
//      per offered rail (settledCalls, zero or not) — cross-referencing what
//      we're PAYING to maintain (facilitator config, canary legs, tests)
//      against what it has ever earned.
//   2. "Top tools by revenue view (call-volume ≠ revenue proxy)": the
//      per-tool table already carried both `calls` and `revenueUsd`, but
//      only ever sorted by calls by default — operatorPage() now renders a
//      standalone top-5-by-revenue list alongside top-5-by-calls so the two
//      leaderboards are visible without clicking a column header.
//
//   node scripts/test-operator-revenue-visibility.js
