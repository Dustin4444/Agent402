// Did yesterday's record actually happen, and does it have data in it?
//
// Two classes of failure this exists for, both of which shipped for real on
// 2026-09-11 and neither of which any existing guard could see:
//
//   1. A COLUMN THAT IS PRESENT AND EMPTY. The routes table recorded 101,733
//      rows with price_usd null on every one, because the allowlist read a
//      field name the crawl row does not carry. The row count was perfect.
//      Nothing that checks "did it run" or "how many rows" can catch that.
//
//   2. A PUBLIC FIELD THAT SILENTLY STOPPED BEING POPULATED. /api/index served
//      network:null and discoveryPath:null for every seller for weeks, because
//      neither survived cache persistence. Found only when something finally
//      counted non-nulls instead of checking for HTTP 200.
//
// So this counts VALUES, never statuses. It reads `recorded` from the operator
// endpoint, which asks the BUCKET - not `status`, which is this process's
// memory and is wiped by every deploy. Reading the memory would file an
// outage every afternoon and be trained away as noise inside a week.
//

//   --target https://agent402.tools   (default)

// Columns whose emptiness is a DEFECT rather than an honest absence. Each one
// is here because it was, or would have been, a silent hole: a buyer reading
// the table would have no way to tell it from real data. Columns that are
// legitimately sparse (a template URL, a crawl error) are deliberately absent
// from this list - asserting on those would produce a guard that cries daily
// and gets ignored, which is worse than no guard.

// Columns we EXPECT to fill but do not assert on yet, with the fill at which
// each becomes worth promoting into MUST_BE_POPULATED above.
//
// This list is why the daily check exists rather than a reminder to look. A
// column at 0% is caught by the empty list; a column at 16% or 37% was
// invisible to every automated surface and needed someone to download the
// NDJSON and count - which is how "provenance on every price" survived as a
// claim while routes.price_source sat at 16% of rows. Measured 2026-09-11 on
// the first recorded day; the `at` figure is the point past which an empty
// value is more likely our defect than an honest absence about the ecosystem.
