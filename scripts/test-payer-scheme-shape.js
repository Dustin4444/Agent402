// Where does a payment payload carry its SCHEME? Ask the installed @x402/core,
// never a fixture and never memory.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. paymentSchemeOf decides whether a request may be
// metered. It read the top-level `scheme` only, which is a v1 field: v2 puts it
// on `accepted`. Every v2 payment therefore read as "no scheme", the caller
// treated that as "not upto", and metering did nothing - with a green unit
// suite, because the fixture was written from the same wrong belief as the code.
// A live buy settled at the full ceiling twice before this was found, and it
// logged nothing either time, since a branch that is skipped says nothing.
//
// A fixture cannot catch that class: it can only ever encode what the author
// already thinks. So this reads @x402/core's OWN schema source and fails when
// the shape our reader depends on is not the shape the library defines - on a
// version bump, or the next time someone reasons from a neighbouring line.
