// Locks the MPP_CHALLENGE_NETWORKS default (2026-08-16 audit) against the
// INSTALLED mppx package rather than trusting a code comment. The claim in
// src/mpp-shim.js is: "a stock mppx client can only natively sign assets in
// its built-in registry (Base + Celo mainnets)" - that used to be an
// unverified assertion. This test reads mppx's real exported Chains/Assets
// and asserts our DEFAULT_CHALLENGE_CHAIN_IDS ({8453, 42220}) is EXACTLY the
// set of mainnet chain ids mppx has a known USDC/USDT asset for - no more,
// no fewer.
//
// This is a drift guard, not a one-time check: a future mppx version bump
// that adds a new mainnet to its registry (their roadmap could add one) SHOULD
// fail this test, prompting a deliberate review of whether
// DEFAULT_CHALLENGE_CHAIN_IDS needs to grow with it - silently missing that
// would mean stock clients on the new chain never get offered an MPP
// challenge even though they could pay one.
