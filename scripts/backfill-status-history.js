// One-time (and safely repeatable) import of heartbeat history into the
// /status probe store.
//
// The heartbeat workflow has been probing production every 15 minutes since
// 2026-06-12, and GitHub has kept every run. Each run therefore holds an
// outside observer's verdict on whether production was serving at that moment.
// This reads those runs and posts them to /api/status/probe so the uptime
// history starts populated with real, publicly checkable observations rather
// than an empty chart.
//
// It is idempotent — the store's UNIQUE (source, component, ts) index means
// re-running imports only genuinely new runs — so it is safe to re-run to pick
// up whatever has happened since.
//
// WHAT COUNTS AS AN OBSERVATION (this is the whole correctness of the import)
//   NOT the run's overall conclusion. A heartbeat run can fail for reasons that
//   say nothing about production: sampling the failures on 2026-07-25 found the
//   issue-management step failing, an unrelated on-chain scan failing, and the
//   runner dying in "Set up job" — while production was serving fine throughout.
//   Importing run conclusions would have drawn roughly 17 outages that never
//   happened.
//
//   So each run is judged by its PROBE STEP alone. If the probe step succeeded,
//   production was up; if it failed, production was down; if it never ran (a
//   runner failure, a cancellation), there is no observation and the run is
//   skipped rather than guessed at.
//
//   GitHub does not expose which individual check inside that step failed, so
//   backfilled rows land on the "api" (overall availability) component only.
//   Per-component history begins when the heartbeat starts posting it live,
//   which is why /status shows "not yet measured" for a component instead of
//   back-projecting onto it.
//
// Usage (needs a GitHub token with actions:read and the operator token):
//   GH_TOKEN=… OP_TOKEN=… node scripts/backfill-status-history.js [--dry] [--limit N]
