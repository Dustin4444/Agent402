// Locks the llms.txt route-execute pricing fix (2026-08-16 audit): the
// "Proportional tiers" sentence was a hand-typed list of 3 tiers
// (execute/execute-plus/execute-max) that silently went stale the moment
// route-execute-pro ($3.30, added 2026-08-04) shipped in route-execute.js -
// nobody remembered to also update this unrelated prose file. Fixed by
// deriving the sentence from EXEC_TIERS directly, so a future 5th tier can't
// repeat the same silent omission.
//
// Also locks a bug caught while building that fix: the first draft built the
// URL as `/api/route/${slug}` (slug is "route-execute-plus"), producing the
// doubled path /api/route/route-execute-plus - the REAL route (registered in
// route-execute.js's buildRouteExecuteTool) strips the "route-execute"
// prefix and prepends "execute", giving /api/route/execute-plus. This test
// asserts every tier URL in the sentence is a route that actually appears in
// the live catalog, not just that some URL-shaped string is present.
//
// Offline - calls llmsTxt() directly and cross-checks against the real
// EXEC_TIERS array + a live catalog fixture.
//
