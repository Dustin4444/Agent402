// The router's reliability floor must not be clearable by one wallet.
//
//   node scripts/test-sor-breadth.js
//
// WHY: the gate compared a settlement COUNT and nothing else, so 50 settlements
// from a single buyer cleared it exactly like 50 buyers settling once. A count
// is manufacturable by a seller paying itself, and volume of exactly that shape
// exists in this ecosystem: one funder cycling USDC through wallets it controls,
// back to its own payTo, with only gas consumed.
//
// The question that produced this came from a seller asking whether repeated
// settlements from one buyer count equally. They did. Now breadth counts too.
//
// The rule, and its limits stated honestly:
//   * count AND distinct payers, where payer data exists
//   * the floor is LOW (3). It defeats the single-wallet loop, which is the
//     cheap attack. It does NOT defeat a funded fleet of wallets, which needs
//     funding-graph analysis this does not attempt.
//   * an origin with NO payer evidence is unknown, not failing. It keeps the
//     old behaviour rather than being refused for a gap in OUR data.
