# Changelog

All notable user-facing changes to the Agent402 server and site. Package
releases are listed under the server version they shipped with; each package
carries its own version on npm.

## Unreleased

Since v2.4.0 (2026-09-18).

### 2026-09-22
- Retire contract-inspect, address-profile, token-info, token-holders and tx-inspect; the routes answer 410 with a replacement.

### 2026-09-21
- Add `POST /v1/judge` ($0.001): typed judgments (a choice from a named set, a
  scored scale, a probability) over a supplied state.
- Accept alternate unit spellings in `unit-convert` (plural/singular, British
  spellings, spaces and underscores, `statute-` prefix); unknown units still 400.
- Add `priceKnown` to `/api/index` sellers, `/api/route` rows and seller detail;
  `priceUsd` is unchanged.
- Accept a seller origin on a non-default port at x402 registration, MPP
  registration and MPP discovery.
- Send `User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Agent402-Router/1.0; +https://agent402.tools/crawler)`
  and `X-Agent402-Via: router` on every paid call the router makes; `/crawler`
  documents it.
- Count a transfer that matches a wallet's published price as a settlement at
  any size on the seller leaderboard; rows carry `settlementsAbovePerCallCeiling`
  and `transfersSkippedOverCeiling`.
- Accept `?limit=` as an alias of `?top=` on `GET /api/leaderboard`.
- Fix heading order on `/reports`, `/monitors`, `/quickstart` and `/transparency`;
  stop `/leaderboard` printing the same figure twice; trim ~6 KB of repeated nav
  style from every page.
- Fix the `x-tweet` documented example to a real tweet id.
- Retired tools and skill packs answer 410 Gone with the retirement date and the
  live replacement instead of a 404.
- Packages: agent402-mcp 0.13.3, agent402-client 0.8.7, agent402-anthropic-tools
  0.1.8, agent402-langchain 0.2.7, agent402-llamaindex 0.1.8,
  agent402-openai-agents 0.1.7, agent402-openai-tools 0.1.8, agent402-strands
  0.1.8 (corrected READMEs, descriptions and the report price ladder on npm).

### 2026-09-18 to 2026-09-20
- Add Google's native `generateContent` wire on every gateway tier.
- Add `POST /v1/audio/transcriptions` (OpenAI transcription wire, multipart).
- Add `service_tier: "priority"` on the pro and premium tiers (2x list, sized by
  the margin clamp); `:nitro` is pinned to the default tier.
- Add `perp-dexs`, `perp-dex-markets` and `perp-dex-limits` on Hyperliquid
  builder-deployed (HIP-3) dexs.
- Add `kalshi-live-data` and `kalshi-weather-index`.
- Add `edgar-13f-datasets` ($0.003) and `edgar-13f-dataset-head` ($0.005).
- Restore `sol-token-holders` (was returning an empty table).
- Move `stock-quote` and `stock-history` onto Databento DBEQ.BASIC: per-venue
  volume is reported as `venueVolume`, `stock-history` accepts up to 250 sessions,
  the 52-week high/low fields are gone.
- Remove `options-chain`, `premarket-quote`, `stock-dividends`,
  `earnings-calendar`, `dividend-calendar` and the `market-open` skill pack.
- Stop selling prepaid card credits; existing keys keep redeeming.
- Add CORS on the machine surfaces (`/api/`, `/v1/`, `/mcp`, `/.well-known/`,
  `/openapi.json`, `/llms.txt`) with the payment headers exposed.
- Point an under-funded buyer at what its balance covers on the 402
  (`retry: "lower-price-route"`).
- Add input aliases for 20 more required parameter names (`barcode`, `upc`,
  `ean`, `coin`, `prompt`, `html`, `hash`, `mint`, `spec`, `payload`, ...).
- Serve an A2A AgentCard at `/.well-known/agent-card.json` and
  `/.well-known/agent.json`, and the ERC-8004 registration file at
  `/.well-known/agent-registration.json`.
- Seed Base and Algorand settlement evidence from our own crawl as well as the
  facilitator catalogs; a seller's detail view echoes its own description and
  tags; re-registering an origin re-reads its documents.
- Add a Monthly bucket to `/revenue`; rebuild the per-chain marketplace pages as
  a dense table; redact upstream error text on `/api/revenue`.
- Add a disclaimer to `dossier`, `research-deep`, `recall-report` and
  `crypto-indicators` output.
- Refuse `cohere/rerank-4-fast` on `/v1/rerank` by name.
- Fix `email-deliverability` reporting a failed DNS lookup as a missing record.
- Ship the OFL licence files with the self-hosted fonts.
- mppx 0.10.1.

## v2.4.0 - 2026-09-18

- Admit `openai/gpt-6-astra` and `anthropic/claude-fable-5.1` on the premium tier.
- Add top-level `effort` on the Messages wire for Claude 4.7+; refuse `speed`
  other than `standard`.
- Move `transcribe` onto `gpt-transcribe` with a 4-minute cap; cap `tts-lite`
  text at 800 chars.
- Add `/api/chain/<verb>` (35 RPC verbs) and five chain reads: `chain-nonce`,
  `chain-storage`, `chain-pending`, `chain-total-supply`, `chain-erc1155-balance`;
  a contract revert is a 422.
- Add `POST /api/attest` (EAS attestation on Base for a settled call) and
  `POST /api/feedback` / `GET /api/feedback/summary`.
- Answer `/api/route` from a candidate index; validate Exa search categories;
  read Polymarket price history from the Data API.
- Add `/x402-test` (`/conformance`, `/debug`), the payment-refusal diagnostic.
- List a migrated seller once: a verified succession retires the predecessor
  while the successor is live.
- Read a route that answers 200 with no paywall as free; re-registration re-asks
  every learned price.
- Read every OpenAPI payment-annotation dialect and object-shaped manifest prices.
- Default `GET /api/leaderboard` to `include=external`; the host's own row carries
  `self: true`.
- Add `POST /api/seller-dossier` ($0.05).
- Add `sanctions-wallet` and `sanctions-name` (OFAC SDN screening).
- Upgrade `@x402/*` to 2.26.0 and `@solana/kit` to 8.3.0; Node 22.23.2.
- Reorder settle fallback: Solvador first where it advertises the network, then
  PayAI.
- Packages: agent402-mcp 0.13.2, agent402-openclaw 0.4.3, elizaos-plugin-agent402
  0.2.3, agent402-agentkit 0.1.3, agent402-tollbooth 0.10.1 (CLI runs through the
  npm bin symlink again), agent402-client 0.8.4 to 0.8.6, agent402-ai-sdk 0.2.7,
  agent402-google-adk 0.1.7.

## v2.3.0 - 2026-09-02

- Carry the typed output schema on every 402 as `accepts[0].outputSchema`.
- Add `rwa-list`, `rwa-markets`, `rwa-asset`, `rwa-issuers`, `rwa-issuer`
  ($0.003 to $0.006).
- Show `executeVia` only on `/api/route` rows the router will pay now; every row
  and index seller carries `routerDispatchEligible` and `routerDispatchReason`.
- Re-read a manifest-priced route's live 402 weekly so newly added rails reach
  the index.
- Retire `gpt-4.1-nano` and the `openai/o4` prefix; `gpt-5.6-luna` is the nano
  default, `gpt-5.6-terra` joins premium; `/v1/images/fast` fails over to
  `gpt-5-image-mini`.
- Answer a refused MCP payment credential with JSON-RPC `-32043`.
- Retry a failed Tempo subscription renewal in minutes and read the chain before
  re-signing after a timed-out send.

  rejected credentials with RFC 9457 problem documents.
- Add MPP subscriptions over `tempo/subscription`.
- Offer cards over MPP (`stripe/charge`) on routes priced $0.50 and up.
- Add `/mpp-marketplace`, `/api/mpp-index` and `/api/mpp-leaderboard`.
- Pay MPP sellers on Tempo through the Smart Order Router; `agent402-client` pays
  MPP sellers.
- Add `/reports` (card checkout for finished reports), `/monitors` ($5/month
  watches) and `/credits` (prepaid card credits).
- Add the report products on `/v1`: research (three tiers), market brief,
  dossier, ticker pack, fund, insider, filing, domain audit, recall, token risk,
  token brief, IPO digest and LinkedIn article.
- Add `/reports/insider/:ticker`, `/reports/fund/:manager` and
  `/reports/dossier/:ticker`.
- Add the metered gateway tier (`POST /v1/metered/chat/completions`): each 402
  quotes the request; `upto` and credits buyers settle actual usage.
- Add the Anthropic Messages and OpenAI Responses wires on every tier,
  `POST /v1/rerank`, the grounded tier, images and video routes.
- Rename the MCP tools to dotted names (`catalog.search`, `catalog.call`, ...);
  the snake_case names remain call aliases.
- Retire 40 free-tier tools and 29 skill packs with no external use in 30 days.
- Redesign the site: light theme by default with a dark toggle, self-hosted fonts.

- Add external execution to the Smart Order Router on Base and Algorand
  (2026-07-21 to 2026-07-23).
- Return the same 402 on HEAD as on GET.

## v2.0.0 - 2026-07-14

- Retire ~970 generated pairwise unit-converter routes in favour of
  `POST /api/unit-convert`; retired routes answer a 410 naming the replacement.
- Rebuild the catalog to 500+ entries; CI enforces a 400-entry floor.
- Relicense the server to AGPL-3.0; `client/`, `mcp/` and `tollbooth/` stay MIT.
- Add `x402-audit`, the Sales ledger, the x402 Economy observatory, Onchain SQL,
