// Self-contained proof-of-work for the tollbooth: a no-wallet payment rail.
// A client without USDC proves it spent real CPU instead — the same scheme
// Agent402 uses, packaged standalone so the tollbooth has zero crypto deps.
//
// Tokens are HMAC-signed by this process (stateless to issue), bound to the
// exact resource they were minted for, expiry-checked, and single-use (a solved
// token is remembered until it expires). Solving costs the caller CPU; issuing
// and verifying cost us one hash + one HMAC.
//
// Single-use is only as wide as the store that records it. The default store is
// THIS PROCESS'S memory, which is exactly right for a single-process deploy and
// insufficient for anything else: a stable TOLLBOOTH_SECRET makes one token
// verifiable by every worker/instance sharing it, so a single solve would buy
// one free request PER PROCESS within the token's TTL (and again after a worker
// recycle). Multi-worker, multi-instance and serverless operators must pass a
// shared `replayStore` (see replay.js and the README).
