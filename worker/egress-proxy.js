// F04: validating + pinning egress proxy for the browser worker.
//
// Chromium resolves DNS and connects on its own, so the app-layer route guard
// (render.js context.route + hostIsPublic) validates a hostname but does NOT
// bind Chromium's actual socket to the checked IP. A DNS-rebinding host can
// return a public IP to the validator and a private one to Chromium's connect,
// reaching *.railway.internal / RFC1918 / loopback / metadata. This closes that
// TOCTOU by making the proxy the ONLY resolver and connector: Chromium is
// launched with --proxy-server pointed here, and for every destination the proxy
// resolves the host ONCE, refuses if ANY resolved address is private/reserved
// (isPrivateIp — the same classifier the SSRF guard uses, which also flags the
// fc00::/7 ULA that *.railway.internal resolves to), and connects to that exact
// PINNED IP. Redirects are re-validated because Chromium re-issues them here.
