# The container image installs as root and this script is PID 1 as root — but
# only long enough to fix up the runtime-mounted volume, then it hands off to
# the unprivileged `node` user so the server (and any renderer/media compromise)
# never runs as root.
#
# Why root-then-drop instead of a Dockerfile `USER node`: Railway mounts the
# persistent volume at /data owned by root:root at RUNTIME (it does not exist at
# build time, so a build-time chown can't touch it). A container that started as
# `USER node` could not write /data, and the memory/stats SQLite would fail its
# boot-fail-loud check. So we chown /data to node here, as root, then exec the
# server as node via gosu.
