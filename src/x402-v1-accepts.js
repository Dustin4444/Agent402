// Translate the ONE v1-era field name a live buyer still sends.
//
// Measured 2026-08-30: a client sent a payment header to /api/render roughly
// nine times a minute for twenty-one hours and was refused every time. Once the
// rejection classifier could report WHICH field of the echoed `accepted` block
// differed from what we advertise, the answer was a single key:
// `maxAmountRequired` - the x402 v1 name for what v2 calls `amount`. Everything
// else in their block matched ours exactly (the classifier reports the UNION of
// differing keys and reported only this one).
//
// x402 deep-equals the echoed entry against the advertised one, so that single
// rename made an otherwise-correct payment unmatchable, and it failed before
// the facilitator with a bare 402.
//
// WHY THIS IS SAFE, and the property that makes it worth doing at all:
//
//   1. STRICTLY NON-REGRESSIVE. It fires only when `accepted.maxAmountRequired`
//      is present AND `accepted.amount` is absent - a shape that is refused
//      100% of the time today. It can only turn a guaranteed failure into a
//      normal match attempt; it can never change the outcome of a payment that
//      works now.
//   2. IT DOES NOT TOUCH THE SIGNATURE. The EIP-3009 authorization signs
//      from/to/value/validAfter/validBefore/nonce. The `accepted` block is the
//      echoed requirements used for matching and is not signed, so renaming a
//      key inside it forges nothing and weakens no cryptography.
//   3. IT DOES NOT WEAKEN THE CHECK. The value is carried across unchanged and
//      the deep-equal still decides. A client that agreed to a DIFFERENT amount
//      still fails to match, exactly as before - this only removes a
//      vocabulary difference, never a disagreement about terms.
//
// AGENT402_X402_V1_ACCEPTS=off disables it.
