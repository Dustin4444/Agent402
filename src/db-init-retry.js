// Boot-time database init with retries. Measured 2026-08-25: the app fires
// initLeadsDb/initAnalyticsDb at module top level, and pg's connection timer
// (connectionTimeoutMillis) expires INSIDE the ~10 s post-listen event-loop
// stall (@x402/express's per-route Ajv compile), so "listening" and both
// "init failed: Connection terminated due to connection timeout" lines share
// one millisecond in the log while a TCP probe a second later connects in
// 10 ms. Every boot lost its databases to its own boot; one deploy in a row
// happened to win the race. So: the first attempt is allowed to fail, and
// the retries land after the stall. `delaysMs` is the schedule after each
// failure; success stops it; exhaustion leaves the module's own on-demand
// path (insertLead / recordToolCall backoff) as the last resort.
