// market-page.js, so the renderer cannot import the index back without a
// cycle (it produced "Cannot access 'CHAIN_PAGES' before initialization" and
// took the whole marketplace down). A pure formatter has no business in either
// of those files anyway.

// The one path the x402 spec names. Every other surface we read is a fallback,
// and that distinction is the whole point of discoveryNote().

 * A one-line, seller-readable account of HOW we found their catalogue.
 *
 * This exists because of #645. A seller watched us request their
 * /.well-known/x402 686 times in one week and take 404 every single time,
 * while their complete catalogue sat at /agents.json the whole while. From
 * their logs it looked like a broken crawler hammering a dead path. From our
 * index it looked like a thin seller. Neither side could see the other half,
 * and the gap was one line of text wide.
 *
 * So: say which surface answered, and when it was not the standard one, say
 * what to publish. Returns null when the seller is on the spec path, because a
 * note that renders for everyone is decoration rather than a signal.
