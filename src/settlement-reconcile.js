// Settlement reconciliation: did the money we were told arrived actually arrive?
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. Settlement is delegated to a facilitator, and we take its
// word for it. `@x402/express` settles after the handler and only for a <400
// response, so a 200 means "the facilitator said this settled" — not "USDC
// moved". Those are different claims, and until this check there was no
// surface anywhere that compared them.
//
// Measured 2026-08-06, Solana: 100 settlements recorded on 08-05 against 89
// transfers on-chain, and 63 against 47 on 08-04. Same buyer throughout, 100
// distinct timestamps (so not replayed), one token account (so nothing was
// missed by looking in the wrong place), and the revenue ledger matched the
// chain exactly on every EVM rail. The gap is settlements that were reported
// successful and never landed: 11% of that rail's calls one day, 25% the next.
// We ran the tool, returned the answer, and were not paid.
//
// This is the mirror of the Stellar defect. There the facilitator reported
// FAILURE for transfers that confirmed, so we did the work and withheld the
// result. Here it reports SUCCESS for transfers that do not, so we do the work
// and hand it over. The first was visible because buyers complained; this one
// is silent, which is why it needs a monitor rather than a bug report.
//
// Amounts are per-call micropayments by design. A rate is the honest unit here,
// not a dollar total: "11 of 100 settlements unconfirmed" is the finding, and
// it stays true whether the tool costs $0.001 or $0.25.
//
// NOT a serving-path fix. The buyer has already been handed the result by the
// time this could run, and blocking a response on chain confirmation would add
// seconds to every call. This detects and reports; it never withholds and never
// tries to claw back.
