/**
 * Payment-nonce replay guard (M3) — defense-in-depth against Attack II
 * ("replay / insufficient idempotency") from the "Five Attacks on x402
 * Agentic Payment Protocol" analysis.
 *
 * Agent402 already settles-before-grant: the paywall buffers the handler's
 * bytes, settles the payment on-chain, and flushes the response ONLY on settle
 * success. Because an EIP-3009 `transferWithAuthorization` nonce is single-use
 * on-chain, a replayed authorization fails at the facilitator, so the
 * duplicate-grant rate is already 1. This guard is a strictly-earlier, cheaper
 * layer: it rejects a duplicate authorization BEFORE it ever reaches the
 * facilitator, and — crucially — closes the concurrent-replay window the paper
 * exploits (the same authorization fired N times at once, racing the settle) by
 * refusing every duplicate while the first is still in flight.
 *
 * Release-on-failure: the nonce is only marked consumed when the gated call is
 * actually granted (a 200 — which, under settle-before-grant, means the payment
 * settled). If the call is NOT granted (the facilitator rejected settlement, the
 * handler threw, the client aborted), the nonce is released so a legitimate
 * retry of the still-valid authorization can succeed. It never blocks a payer
 * from re-using an authorization the chain hasn't consumed.
 *
 * CROSS-REPLICA (2026-08-16): prod runs multiple replicas (RATE_LIMIT_REPLICAS),
 * and the guard below was per-process only - a concurrent replay landing on
 * TWO DIFFERENT replicas within the same request window was invisible to it
 * (each replica's inFlight Set only sees its own traffic). The chain's own
 * nonce single-use property still prevented a double-CHARGE, but the HANDLER
 * ran twice - for a tool that makes a real paid upstream call, that is a real
 * cost duplication bounded only by how fast an attacker can fire one
 * authorization at two replicas.
 *
 * Now backed by the SAME Redis connection shared-limit.js already maintains
 * (via getSharedRedisClient - one connection per process, not a second one to
 * the same server) when REDIS_URL is configured and reachable. FAILS OPEN to
 * the original per-process Map/Set on any Redis absence or failure - this is
 * the opposite fail-direction from shared-limit.js's rate limiter, and
 * deliberately so: that limiter protects a metered FREE-TIER budget, where
 * failing open means unmetered free access (a direct loss). This guard is
 * documented defense-in-depth on top of a chain-enforced guarantee that holds
 * with or without it, so degrading to "exactly today's per-process guarantee"
 * during a Redis blip is strictly better than refusing every paid call over
 * an optimization layer going dark.

 *
 * Bounded: entries expire after `ttlMs` (well past any realistic authorization
 * validity window) and total LOCAL consumed entries are capped at `maxEntries`
 * with FIFO eviction (Redis expires its own keys via TTL, no separate cap
