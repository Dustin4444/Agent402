// "Stop offering this client an MPP challenge so it falls through to x402."
//
// Companion to src/mpp-evm-domain.js. Once a client has PROVEN (by a signature
// that recovers to its own payload `from`) that it signs EIP-3009 under the
// wrong token domain name, its MPP evm path cannot work here - but its x402
// path demonstrably can (measured on the AgentCore instrument, Base tx
// 0x9b48b7fe...). The remedy is to withhold the `WWW-Authenticate: Payment`
// challenges from that client for a short while: a manager that prefers MPP
// then has nothing to select, and falls back to the x402 offer already sitting
// in the same 402's PAYMENT-REQUIRED header.
//
// WHY IT IS STICKY AT ALL. Suppressing only on the response to the failing
// credential is not enough: an agent that retries the tool call starts a FRESH
// request that carries no credential, sees the challenge again, and loops. So a
// client is remembered briefly, keyed by remote address + User-Agent - the only
// identity a bare unpaid request has.
//
// WHY THAT KEY IS DANGEROUS, AND WHAT BOUNDS IT. The flag cannot be planted on
// a victim (setting it needs a signature that recovers to the sender's own
// `from`), but the key itself is not exclusive: anyone can self-sign a
// wrong-domain credential with a throwaway wallet while choosing their own
// User-Agent, and co-locating behind a shared egress IP (cloud NAT, corporate
// proxy, an agent host) is ordinary. A collateral hit is therefore possible,
// and for one buyer it is worse than a downgrade: this predicate also gates the
// TEMPO challenge, and a wallet funded only in USDC.e/PathUSD has no x402 offer
// it can pay, so a blanket suppression would be a total payment denial for a
// client we have no evidence about. The suppression is bounded so that can
// never be more than a blip:
//
//   - a request that CARRIES a Payment credential is never suppressed. Such a
//     client is mid-flow on some method and needs a fresh challenge to retry;
//     only bare requests, plus the wrong-domain rejection itself, are steered.
//   - stickiness requires a non-empty User-Agent. An empty UA is the widest
//     possible net (Node's fetch sends none), so it gets the immediate response
//     only and is never remembered.
//   - it lapses after MAX_SUPPRESSED responses as well as after the TTL. A
//     manager that is going to fall back does so on its next attempt, so a
//     handful is generous for the client we mean and a blip for anyone else.
//
// Bounded map, single process; MPP_EVM_DOMAIN_FALLBACK=off disables it all.
