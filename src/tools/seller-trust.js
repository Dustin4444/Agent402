// Seller trust check — the evidence our OWN router uses before it spends buyer
// money on an external x402 seller, served as a tool.
//
// Inputs, both already maintained continuously for the router: the seller crawl
// (manifest validity, tool count, advertised chains, health) and observed
// on-chain settlement counts from the leaderboard. This tool reads those two
// sources and reports the router's gate; it computes no new evidence.
//
// DETERMINISTIC AND OFFLINE BY CONSTRUCTION: it never fetches the seller at
// call time. A paid handler that dials a third party would add an SSRF surface,
// unbounded latency, and a verdict that changes with the seller's uptime rather
// than with the evidence. Everything here comes from the crawler cache and the
// leaderboard snapshot, both refreshed on their own schedules.
//
// HONEST ABOUT LIMITS: "unknown" is a first-class answer. An origin we have
// never crawled returns listed:false with a stated reason, never a low score
// that reads like a bad verdict. Absence of evidence is reported as absence,
// the same rule /status follows for uptime gaps.
