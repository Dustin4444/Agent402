// Worker that decodes, transforms and re-encodes an image in an isolated thread,
// so the pure-JS synchronous Jimp pipeline can never occupy the server's event
// loop. Those three tools (resize/convert/thumbnail) are free on the authless
// MCP connector and free via proof-of-work, so an unauthenticated caller could
// otherwise stall PAID traffic and the paywall itself: measured before this
// move, three concurrent calls took /health from 39ms to 6.1s.
//
// Unlike src/tools/regex-worker.js this worker is LONG-LIVED and handles one job
// per message. A per-call worker would be correct too, but importing jimp costs
// ~45ms of module evaluation on every spawn (~75-105ms total wall for a job that
// otherwise takes single-digit ms), and that overhead would be paid by every
// caller to contain a pathological minority. The pool in image-pool.js keeps the
// jimp import warm and terminates the worker outright when a job overruns, so
// the containment property is the same as regex-worker's.
